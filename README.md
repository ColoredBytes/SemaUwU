## :x: Problem

I've used Semaphore for about a year and loved it. But always hated that I needed to either use docker or install all this manually. Which is not an issue but hey why not make life easier? 

## :heavy_check_mark: Solution

I Created **SemaUwU**  after watching [Learn Linux TV](https://www.learnlinux.tv/complete-ansible-semaphore-tutorial-from-installation-to-automation/#more-4065) on installing semaphore and thought. Ahh cool a good base to base the script off of. I just need the logic to grab the Latest Release. 

## :gear: Instructions

- **Clone Repo.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ColoredBytes/SemaUwU.git
```
- **Make the script executable.**

```bash
chmod +x SemaUwU/install.sh
```
- **Run the script.**
 
 ```bash
 ./SemaUwU/install.sh
```
